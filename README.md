## What is QoS?

Quality of service (QoS) is the use of mechanisms or technologies to control traffic and ensure the performance of critical applications. The term QoS originated in the field of telecommunication and is widely used today in computer networking for traffic prioritization.

## What is `kong-plugin-qos-classifier`?

This is a custom kong plugin which can classify requests into configured QoS classes based on thresholds defined in terms of `requests/sec` and inject the value in the configured HTTP header.

## Use-cases of the plugin

This plugin can help in progressive and pro-active load shedding, at flow level, whenever unexpected spikes in traffic are seen. This is discussed in detail in this [blog](https://engineering.cred.club/qos-through-progressive-load-shedding-during-high-scale-events-part-1-9ab2282c0040)

## Features of the plugin

- Categorizes the requests into various classes based on the `req/s` threshold defined.
- Sends custom value of a predefined header to the upstream service based on the class identified, based on which the upstream service can gracefully handle degradations by load shedding desired flows.
- Supports terminating the requests after breaching the highest threshold with custom status code.
- Also supports sending custom header to clients when a request is terminated. Eg, sending a `Location` header with a static CDN URL and `302` status code.
- The classification of requests happen locally in a kong node without any dependency on any central datastore, which makes it performant.
- An endpoint, like that from [`kong-plugin-cluster-stats`](https://github.com/CRED-CLUB/kong-plugin-cluster-stats), could be configured to dynamically update the calculation based on the current number of kong nodes in the cluster.

### Prometheus metrics

The plugin also emits the following prometheus metrics with kong version >= `2.6.0`

```
# HELP kong_qos_request_threshold Threshold for QoS class differentiation
# TYPE kong_qos_request_threshold gauge
kong_qos_request_threshold{class="<class_name>",route="<route>",service="<service>"} 1
# HELP kong_qos_total_requests Total requests received so far
# TYPE kong_qos_total_requests counter
kong_qos_total_requests{class="<class_name>",route="<route>",service="<service>"} 10
```

## Installation and Loading of the plugin

Follow [standard procedure](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/2.0.x/plugin-development/distribution/) to install and load the plugin.

This plugin also requires the following `shared_dict`s to be defined in nginx configuration. The following is the kong configuration for the same:

```
nginx_http_lua_shared_dict = qos_shared 12m; lua_shared_dict qos_lock 100k
```

## Enabling the plugin

The plugin can be enabled at `service`, `route` or `global` levels. In case of multiple instances of plugins enabled for a request, evaluation only happens for the highest level. The order of precedence is (starting from the highest level):

- `route`
- `service`
- `global`

## Configuring the plugin

The plugin has the following configuration object:
```
{
  "config": {
    "termination": {
      "status_code": 302,
      "header_name": "Location",
      "header_value": "https://cred.club"
    },
    "upstream_header_name": "X-QOS-CLASS",
    "node_count": {
      "http_timeout_in_ms": 15,
      "update_initial_delay_in_sec": 5,
      "update_url": "http://localhost:8001/cluster-stats",
      "initial": 2,
      "update_frequency_in_sec": 1
    },
    "classes": {
      "class_1": {
        "threshold": 4,
        "header_value": "green"
      },
      "class_2": {
        "threshold": 6,
        "header_value": "red"
      },
      "class_3": {
        "threshold": null,
        "header_value": null
      },
      "class_4": {
        "threshold": null,
        "header_value": null
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|upstream_header_name|HTTP header to be sent to upstream services which carries the class of the request (default: X-QOS-CLASS)|
|classes.class_1.threshold|Threshold in req/s for 1st class of requests|
|classes.class_1.header_value|Value of the header identified by `upstream_header_name` when the requests is within `classes.class_1.threshold`|
|node_count.initial|Initial number of kong nodes|
|termination.status_code|HTTP status code to send when the threshold of the highest class is crossed (default: 429)|
|termination.header_name|HTTP header to send when the request is terminated|
|termination.header_value|Value of `termination.header_name` header to be sent|
|node_count.update_url|HTTP endpoint to hit to get updated number of nodes. The response should have `num_nodes` json field. If this is not set, node counts are not updated dynamically and `node_count.initial` is used|
|node_count.http_timeout_in_ms|HTTP timeout in ms for `node_count.update_url` endpoint (default: 10)|
|node_count.update_frequency_in_sec|Interval at which to update the node count (default: 1)|
|node_count.update_initial_delay_in_sec|Number of seconds to wait before initiating node update calls. This is to make sure that the cluster stabalises before making these calls, eg in case of a rolling deployment of the cluster. Till this time, the configured `node_count.initial` is used for the calculation (default: 15)|
